Because financialization has created an enormous rise in the value of assets on nations’ balance sheets. The motivation has been less to earn a profit on tangible capital investment than to generate “capital” gains.\nThe secular rise of debt service absorbs the economic surplus diverting spending away from the purchase of goods and services (real economy).\nPaying debt service to bankers and bondholders leaves less income available to spend on goods and services. So debt deflation is today’s major problem, not inflation.\nBy 2008 banks were giving out zero-down-payment mortgages with no amortization, “interest only” loans. Until 1980s, most bank guidelines called for housing costs not to absorb more than a quarter of the debtor’s income.\nInterest is treated as “profit” earned by bankers’ product: the debt taken on by borrowers. Treating the banks’ privileged of credit creation as tangible industrial investment conflates money and credit as a “factor of production”, so that interest, penalties and fees appear as part of the production process, not external to it. Credit creation for GDP, consumption or assets purchases…\nDebt monetization by the government (i.e., Ireland) requires more public taxes in order to service such debt. So fiscal austerity on top of financial austerity. Squeezing out more to pay the bondholder resulting in a shrinkage of the economy.\nInstead of re-capitalize the economy and monetizing federal debt like the Bank of England and the Fed did, they ECB demands that debt-strapped countries add a tax burden to the debt overhead, so as to limit the budget deficit while creating a hemorrhage of bank subsidies.\nSell-offs of public monopolies such as roads and other infrastructure are turned into opportunities for rent extraction.\nSocialist who tell the rhetoric of class war between labor and industry miss the threat to labor and industry posed by banks and rentiers of the FIRE sectors and monopolies, financialization.\nTwo traditions of financial doctrine Today’s leading nations have achieved their global advantage as a result of a strategy based on industrial and agricultural innovation employing well educated, highly paid, highly productive labor. A tradition whose roots extend back to before the Industrial Revolution has advocated public infrastructure investment, subsidies to key industries, and encouragement to skilled immigrants, as well as protectionist economic policy. This tradition has called for government money and control of finance to steer money and credit creation to promote tangible capital investments [Japan window guidance].\nThe combination of fiscal policy and bank regulation determines the volume of credit and how savings are recycled, overshadowing labor costs in determining international trade competition.
